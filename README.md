>>we propose single-cell Self-Attention Generative Adversarial Networks(scSAGAN), a semi-supervised imputation method for scRNA-seq data. scSAGAN mainly uses semi-supervised learning (SSL) and Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA), which can not only learn the potential characteristics of different types of cells, but also explain its own imputation behavior.
